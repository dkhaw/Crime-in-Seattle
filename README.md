Visual Layout / Encodings
I selected a geographic layout over a map of Seattle because I felt it was the best way to impart my data, which is obviously very geographic in nature. Crime tends to vary greatly across geographic boundaries, so I needed to maintain this geographic dimension in my visualization. To encode this data, I selected red circles that were easily visible in contrast to the black outline of the map. Each circle represents one police report. I set an opacity on these circles so that viewers could view the overlapping of data points. This gives it the effect of a heatmap, where viewers are drawn to the more deeply colored areas of the map that have a higher frequency of reports. 

Control Features
My first control feature was a dropdown selection box containing the list of offenses. This gives viewers the power to select from 65 different offenses, giving them a wide variety of options to choose from. It also allows them to pinpoint a single offense and ask more direct questions about the data than if they were viewing crime as a whole. For instance, you can select the offense Bike Theft and see that it occurs frequently throughout northern Seattle and the downtown area but very rarely south of there. This could likely be due to the fact that there are many bike commuters around the downtown area as well as north near the UW campus. The higher number of bikes around could result in a greater number of bike thefts. 
My second control feature was the range slider to select the month of the year (from 2015) to view. This allows viewers to grasp the seasonality differences of crime in Seattle. This also tends to have a great effect on the trends in crime. A good example of this is when viewing Prostitution throughout the year. Prostitution arrests are at their highest point in the summer months but drop down to almost nothing during the winter. This could be due to the fact that prostitutes are able to work longer hours in the summer when it is warmer outside.
